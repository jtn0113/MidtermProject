What is Sip.?

Sip., is a web based application that allows a user to create journal entries based upon different alcoholic beverages they've tried. The purpose of the journal entry is to save and store the information about a specific drink for the user. For example, if you were a wine connoisseur you could add unique journal entries detailing all of the different wines you've tasted. Perhaps you had a fantastic wine while dining with friends down the street or a lovely pinot noir while traveling abroad in Italy, you can create and save those memories in the Sip. application.

### How It Works:

When a user accesses the welcome page they can:
<ul>
<li> Existing user? Add your username and password to login</li>
<li> New user? Select "Create New" to register your new account<li>
</ul>

Once logged in the user has the following options:
<ul>
<li> Read previous journal entries on the home page</li>

From the navigation bar:
<li> Search previous entry by drink name</li>
<li> View  and update their personal account information</li>
<li> Create a new tasting (beer, wine, spirit)</li>
<li> View friends list where the user can search and add a new friend or remove friends from current list</li>
<li> Logout</li>
<li> If the user has admin priveledges they will also be able to "Manage Users" from the navigation bar where they can activate and deactivate users</li>
 </ul>

 How CRUD was implemented:

 Create:
 <ul>
 <li> User can create an account</li>
 <li> User can create a beer, wine, or spirit journal</li>
 </ul>

 Read:
 <ul>
 <li> User can search for existing journal entry by drink name</li>
 <li> User can view previous journal entries</li>
 <li> User can search for friends by username</li>
 <ul>

 Update:
 <ul>
 <li> User can update personal account information</li>
 <li> User can update previous journal entries</li>
 <li> User can add or remove friends from friends list</li>
 <li> User can delete previous journal entries</li>
